# Professional-Portfolio

## Description
  For this project, I wanted to create a personal professional portfolio I could use to introduce myself, my work, and my contact information to potential employers. I built this because I heard that many employers choose to see one's projects in order to assess whether they want to hire you or not. This portfolio gives me a place where I could not only present my skills, but provide a place where I can keep adding projects I make in the future. The contact section provides a link to my GitHub page, a link LinkedIn, my email, and my phone number. Through making this portfolio, I learned about how responsiveness of the layout could get very difficult as a webpage gets more complicated. In addition, I was able to see how creating a stylesheet that fits the standards of multiple web browsers could be tricky. However, other than learning about the importance and difficulty of making a responsive layout, I also learned about the multiple ways to use flexbox.
